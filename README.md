## KanbanBoard

This is an implementation of a Kanban board using Typescript, React, and Redux. The Kanban board allows you to create tasks, move tasks, and assign tags to tasks. Use it to track your work!



## Technologies 🛠️

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types.
- [React](https://es.reactjs.org/) - Front-End JavaScript library
- CSS
- HTML
- [Feather Icons](https://feathericons.com/) - Simply beautiful open source icons
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For component composition and styles
- [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - Library for creating navigations in one page applications in React.

## Features

### Drag and drop columns and task cards

  - User can move their task into different columns to keep track of progress or organise their data
  - Columns can move freely, allowing users to put their lists in any order they want.



### Task creation and editable task

  - Each task and list can be created by pressing the add buttons to their respected components

  - Each task and list can be deleted at any time

  - Once clicked, a task will expand into a modal for easy accessibility to read, write and edit.

    

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
